# Data Visualization Tech Boot Camp Presentation

I presented this at the first Georgia Community Action Tech Boot Camp for my internship at Georgia Community Action Association. 
The presentation focused on the story that could be created from data visualization by reviewing the Audits of the 2022 Calendar Year. 
I read through data stored in Excel utilizing Python's wlrd library in order to create several data sets for the presentation. The data
sets were created with Matpotlib and data structures such as lists and dictionaries.
